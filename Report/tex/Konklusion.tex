\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this project was to create a distributed software system.
This culminated in a digitized board game, which was done through an analysis
of an existing physical board game ‘Battleships’. The analysis allowed the
 group to see the essential components of the game required in order to
 implement a digital version.

The distribution of the software allowed a client and server to communicate
in order to exchange requests and messages. This allowed two clients to play
 a networked multiplayer game of Shipwars Online through the server. The game
  can be played from start to finish, where a winner is declared in the end.
   Multiple multiplayer games can exist at any time allowing many pairs to
   play concurrently.

Connecting to the general services allowed a user to login, returning a token
to be used for the game services. Connecting to game services with the token
 verified the user in the system, allowing the game services to store the user
  connection in a session instance. This way users could be identified through
  their session, making communication both ways possible.

The overall conclusion for the project is that though the group had some
 problems with the new programming language and frameworks (WCF and WPF)
  used, it managed to answer the questions that was stated at the beginning
   of the project. And the group made a prototype that shows how it decided
    to make a distributed software system.
