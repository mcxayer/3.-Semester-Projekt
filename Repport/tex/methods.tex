\chapter{Methods}

In this section the methods used in the project will be explained and why they were used.

\section{Unified Process}

We used UP as a guideline for the project as a whole, which means
that Scrumban was our main structure for the project, and during the
start of the project the inception phase of UP was used when we created
 the inception document.

\section{Scrumban}

This is an agile method for creating a product. It is a hybrid
between Scrum and Kanban, utilizing the best of both methods. It
 combines the sprint iteration style from scrum with the bucket list
  and whiteboard planning style of Kanban. It works by putting all the
   requirements for the project onto sticky notes. This then becomes the
    backlog for work, and when a scrum sprint starts the requirement is
     evaluated by its importance. This helps to prioritize the task for a
      given sprint. There is also a limit on how many requirements that can
       be worked on at a given sprint, which will help to make sure that
        resources are not spend unnecessarily and the tasks get done.
