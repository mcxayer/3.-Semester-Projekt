\chapter{Abstract}

The overall purpose of this project is to make a distributed system involving
 a database, a server and a client. In order to specify this purpose into an
  actual project, it was chosen to digitize the well-known board game
   “Battleship” and call it “ShipWars Online” in order to avoid copyright
    issues. \\
This was done by examining the core rules of the game and write
 a C{\#} application connected to a database and a server, and apply
  the game-rules and graphical user-interface equivalent to the look
   of the board game.\\
The result was a C{\#} application that, when executed, functioned as
 a digitized version of the board game with features to login and search
  for matches against other players, if they are logged in.
